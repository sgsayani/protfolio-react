Through natural language processing, we describe the human behaviors and characteristics of the chatbot. In this paper, we propose an AI Chatbot interaction and prediction model using a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron. Our analysis discovered a gap in knowledge about theoretical guidelines and practical recommendations for creating AI chatbots for lifestyle improvement programs.",
